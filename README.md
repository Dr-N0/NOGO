# NOGO and various other viruses
NOGO is a packaging script that creates fully undetectable payloads specializing in disabling anti-virus. Created for pentesting (crippling computers) not destroying them.
All viruses were worked on by myself and a friend for the purpose of testing the limitations of Go as a meathod to ignore AV software.
